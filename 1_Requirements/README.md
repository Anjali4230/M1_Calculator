calculator


calculator is a device that performs arithemetic operation on numbers.the simpliest calculator can do addition,subtraction , multiolication and many more.

the simpliest question regrading calculator is 

1. what it can do:

the project calculator can perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication , division plus it can do some standard function such as power, cube, squareroot,factorial and square.

2. when it perform operation:
when user choose operation such as addition if user ask for it will ask for . firstly it ask to user that how many number they want to add suppose 5, then user has to enter those 5 number and press ENTER tab it will automatically shows the sum of those.
the rest of operations work like that only.

3. whom :
user can only enter number that is in the form of digits only.

 4. why:
 we have calculator for making our calculation easier and we can perform the various operations by this device.



STRENGTH:
Calculator in the elementary grades serve as aids in advancing student understanding without replacing the need for other calculation methods
calculator use can promote the higher order thinking and reasoning needed for the problem solving  in our infornmtion and technology based society.


WEAKNESS:
there are many instants where a students or individuals can make mistakes , such as punching the WRONG button, forgetting to change the mode , incorrect rounding up of values and wrong methods of evaluating brackets
some of the weakness are :

dependency,
highcost

 

  Scope: 

This document specifies the functional requirements for a multi-function calculator program.
The program is designed to act like a “handheld calculator” with the usual standard functions
(add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation, and memory).  The program is designed
to be as easy to use as a regular calculator.


Hardware and Software :

The program shall be written in standard C, as compiled by the GNU C++ compiler
