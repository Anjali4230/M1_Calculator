calculator is a device that performs arithemetic operation on numbers.the simpliest calculator can do addition,subtraction , multiolication and many more.

the simpliest question regrading calculator is 

1. what it can do:

the project calculator can perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication , division plus it can do some standard function such as power, cube, squareroot,factorial and square.

2. when it perform operation:
when user choose operation such as addition if user ask for it will ask for . firstly it ask to user that how many number they want to add suppose 5, then user has to enter those 5 number and press ENTER tab it will automatically shows the sum of those.
the rest of operations work like that only.

3. whom :
user can only enter number that is in the form of digits only.

 4. why:
 we have calculator for making our calculation easier and we can perform the various operations by this device.



STRENGTH:
Calculator in the elementary grades serve as aids in advancing student understanding without replacing the need for other calculation methods
calculator use can promote the higher order thinking and reasoning needed for the problem solving  in our infornmtion and technology based society.


WEAKNESS:
there are many instants where a students or individuals can make mistakes , such as punching the WRONG button, forgetting to change the mode , incorrect rounding up of values and wrong methods of evaluating brackets
some of the weakness are :

dependency,
highcost

 

  Scope: 

This document specifies the functional requirements for a multi-function calculator program.
The program is designed to act like a “handheld calculator” with the usual standard functions
(add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation, and memory).  The program is designed
to be as easy to use as a regular calculator.


Hardware and Software :

The program shall be written in standard C, as compiled by the GNU C++ compiler 




## TEST REPORT AND OUTPUT
 In this repository i am addding the test report and output of my project with the help of pictures .

like in the first picture the operation is addition , it will ask user how many number they want to add , once the user type hose number then it will take the numbers from user and shows the output for eg in the sccrenshot i have added the user want to add 3 numbers 
in the next line the user enter those numbers which are 23, 2 and 13  when user click on enter tab it will show the result which is 38.

In the second picture user want to subtract two number which are 30 and 15 . so the output is 15.

  In the next operation user wants to multiply two operator which are40 and 32 then it will show the output as1280.

In the next operation user want to divide two number in this case if denominator is 0 it simply show the 0 as output otherwise it perform the operation.

 The next operator is  square it simply take a number and give iutput as the square of those numbers.

 the next operator is cube it simply take a number and shows the output as cube of those number.

 the next operator is the power operator it take two value first the base value and the second exponent value .and then show the output by performin the operations.

 the next operator is the modolous operator , it take two numbers and show their result.

 the last operator ia a factorial it take a umber and shows the factorail of those number .
  
  this is how the operation works.
